To run it, follow the procedure:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
$ python authenticate.py user password
$ python upload.py storage_url auth_token file

Enjoy.

The required python modules are requests and python-swiftclient. Note
that the python-swiftclient version available in Debian wheezy is not
recent enough. Hence the use of virtualenv.
